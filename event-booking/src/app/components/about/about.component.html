<p class="about">
    My name is Johnny Cash and I am a legendary figure in the world of Rock and Roll. I am willing to play at music
    festivals,
    weddings, concert halls, and even bars. My music is on the lighter side of classic rock, but it is timeless. I am
    also a member of
    the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame.
